General steps:
  - event : starts with a project idea
  - discovery : phase
  - program funnel : and creates a release plan
  - project continues through the program funnel into delivery where the work is completed in iterations
  - delivery: continuously monitors the completion and delivery

Discovery:
  - business value of the work 
  - sponsor : speak on behalf of users
  - technical person : technical aspect of what is being envisioned
  - Client representation


  workshop:
    - Identify Problem or Opportunity
    - What is the outcome or goals weâ€™re trying to achieve
    - Identify Blockers
    - Identify Solutions
    - Identify Work : epics, mvp

  benefits:
    - approved proposal
    - shared understanding 
    - Prioritize work
    - better decisions on how the work will get done

Program Funnel:

  Defining Work:
    - shared understanding of Agile through
    - Everyone should have an idea about the project goals
    - Social contract
    - Backlog creation and refinement
    - Epic creation
    - Feature Identification
    - Story elaboration
    - Team should know the standard and regulations to follow
    - Tools
    - Release goals and planning

  Release Plan:
    In Agile, a well-done plan is known as the release plan
    A release plan is organized using columns

    Steps:
      - Populate the backlog with the activities and features
      - Determine which features to move into each release from the backlog.
      - Leave non-committed stories in the backlog 
    

  Wall of Work:
    track progress and see the status of all tasks
    (jira story board)

  User Stories:
    Levels of work:
      - Epics : high-level activities that span multiple iterations and possibly releases
      - Features : break the epics into smaller chunks known as features -> proposed functionality -> one iteration
      - Stories : tasks that are ready for the team to build - individual task

    As a ....... I can ........ so that......

    A story should have:
      - Title
      - Priority
      - End user
      - User story
      - Tasks
      - Team members
      - Acceptance criteria

      Definition of done -> the standards -> story to be accepted by the product owner
      Acceptance criteria -> specific to each story -> when the specific piece of work is done.
      The definition of done -> all stories -> standards that must be met -> completed.

Delivery:
  Iterations:
    2-4 week period

    cycle:
      - Iteration planning - sprint planning
      - Backlog
      - Pull work
      - Backlog refinement - midsprint
      - Execute work - work
      - Daily standups
      - Showcase -what we did
      - Retrospective -how the process went
