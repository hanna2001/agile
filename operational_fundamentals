Operations : repeatable processes—processes that bring value—that are continuous in nature with no defined start and end date.
Agile methods can be applied to that approach or pattern to improve work completion and success.

Program work
Any type of project work with a defined start and end date

The operations pattern is the approach used to get operations work done.

Operation pattern
- Request
- Prioritize
- Operational Funnel
- Delivery

One important aspect of the operations pattern is continuous process improvement : operation processes, even though they are continuous and repeatable and are done all the time, still may need improvements for better results.



Applying Agile to operations:

    Social Contact:
        the social contract is created by a team who owns a process or part of a process

    Iteration:
        plans what all to complete in an iteration (how sprint works) 3-4 weeks
        A team chooses the work to be completed from the funnel in each iteration.
    
    Wall of work:

    Stand ups:
        one in a month

    Retro:
        how they can improve the way they work for better results.
    
Agile Operation Teams:

    Self directed teams:
        Agile teams are cross-functional
        The team includes:
            core: dedicated
                iteration manager -> team lead : SS
                product owner -> process owner, owner of work -Holds the “product” or “outcome” vision : PM
                subject matter experts : ME F
                doers : HSM AMT HH
            extended: assist when in need
                Agile program or project manager -> provide management guidance and insight on any associated Agile projects or series of projects (programs) that might impact day-to-day operations.
                stakeholders -> A stakeholder is a person who has an interest or investment : Fl
                change manager -> implement changes in its processes => easier transitions, with minimal disruptions :Oven
                some subject matter experts -> special expertise or skill that are different than the core team SME : Oven
            governance: provides guidance and direction for the overall team
                Steering Committee -> project governance meeting where the big decisions are made
                Sponsor -> motivation and exposure for the team at a higher level

    emphasis on just-in-time delivery,
    wall of work

    Principles:
        Visualize : wall of work
        Limit WIP : having the work pushed to them by management regardless of readiness. 
        Manage Flow : monitor the flow of work for best optimization
        Make process policies explicit : make all rules and guidelines around the process explicit and visible to everyone
        Improve collaboratively
